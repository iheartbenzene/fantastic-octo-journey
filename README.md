# fantastic-octo-journey

A small budget idea with which I am toying.

Essentially, this started because I wanted a budget that would update itself with how much I could be expected to spend over the course of the next pay period. I also wanted it to update my pay periods automatically with each new instance of gained wages; all of this while telling me what my most/least expensive spending points were. Then I want it to group common spending locations by geographic location...but that's a long way off. 

However, if you've read this far then, the files are written in GNU Octave but are also readable by Matlab.

To acquire GNU Octave: 

1. In your web browser, go to https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

2. Click "download".

3. Select your operating system.

Windows: 

If you have a newer computer, choose Windows-64 (recommended) || octave-5.1.0-w64-installer.exe (~ 286 MB)

Linux:

1. Open a terminal instance.

2. Type the command apt install octave

  2b. Use the command, sudo apt install octave, if you get a permissions error.
